-= Dr.Doak Facility Scientist v1.0 =- by Mr.Bumpy 21/4/2000

Description: This is the skin of Dr.Doak from Goldeneye64. It is uses the Gman model. It replaces the cwpscientist model but you can use it seperately as long as you follow the instructions below.

Time: 2 hours of trial and error!!

Programs: Paintshop Pro 5 and Half-Life Model Viewer v1.24

Bugs: Seams in the skin. Not noticeable in-game. Long neck. Thin head. It's not my model!!

Please let me know what you think!! So I know what needs to be improved on. I hope you enjoy it!!! Tell me if this was the correct model to use as I was going to use the connery model again. I like to thank the creator of the Gman model!!!

I'll be making more player skins (helicopter pilot next) and weapon skins to make the excellent Goldeneye Half-Life MOD more GE64 Bondish...(sorry, I'm addicted ).
