-= Russian Soldier Skin v1.1=- by Mr.Bumpy

Description: This is the skin of the Russian Soldier from Goldeneye. It is used on the Connery model.

Time: 2 hours to get it all right!!

Programs: Paintshop Pro 5 and Half-Life Model Viewer v1.24

Please let me know what you think!! So I know what needs to be improved on. I hope you enjoy it!!! I like to thank Thomas Keogh (a.k.a. Malakili) for his Soldier skin as I used it as a template.

I'll be making more player skins (scientist next) and weapon skins to make the excellent Goldeneye Half-Life MOD more GE64 Bondish...(sorry I couldn't help it).

Many thanks to the Connery model creator as I'll be using it for the later models too!!!
