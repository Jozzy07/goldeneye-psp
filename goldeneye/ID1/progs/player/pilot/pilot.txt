-= Helicopter Pilot skin v1.0  =-  by Mr.Bumpy 23/4/2000

Description: This skin is of the helicopter pilot from Goldeneye64. It uses the excellent Dukowski model.

Time: 2 hours to get the helmet right (the skin)

Programs: Paintshop Pro 5 and Half-Life Model Viewer v1.24

Bugs: The helmet doesn't look like a pilot's helmet (not my fault). Due to how the model is set out, I made the helmet shiny because it was nearly impossible to put detail that would show up properly on it. The pouch. Well the model isn't exclusive but was the closest  (Barney???) to looking like the heli pilot. You can change the colour of the skin in the player customisation menu (I consider it a bug). Can someone tell me if I got it right from the waist down since I don't know what's below (mind the unintended pun).

Other skins by author (in order of completion): "proper" Boris, "better" Russian soldier and Dr.Doak. All are for GE-HL.

Please let me know what you think!! So I know what needs to be improved on. I hope you enjoy it!!! Tell me if this was the correct model to use as I was going to use the Barney model instead. I like to thank Mike "Spider" Morace, creator of the Dukowski model!!!

I'll be making more player skins (Civilian maybe, not sure yet. Please tell me) and weapon skins to make the excellent Goldeneye Half-Life MOD more GE64 Bondish...(sorry, I can't help myself ). If you find that some skins are blurry or plain, that's how they look in GE64.
